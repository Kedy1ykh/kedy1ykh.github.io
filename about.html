<p class="mb-5">
We just want to make journaling a habit and keep a record of what we do. Journaling can reminds us about our mistake, and that indicates room for improvement.
Hopefully when we look back in the future, we see progress.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">
We have share similar interest, sometimes we discuss over topic that each of us are good at, sometimes we spar over our understandings. Ultimately,
for us, we just want each other to act as the support and driving force for our progress.
</p>

Hope whoever sees this blog, find the topic we shared here useful, and probably help some of you to make less mistake on your journey.
